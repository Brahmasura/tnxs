          <img src={lifeTwo} alt="the advantages" />

          <p className={style.paraBold}>
            A student in Russia needs USD 300 to 400 per month on average or USD
            3,000 to 4,000 per academic year (September to June).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's better to start with a further USD 300 to 400 for extra
            expenses like medical insurance, living arrangements in an apartment
            or dormitory (buying dishes, bed linen, detergents etc.), and to
            purchase books. <br />
            The roubleâ€™s decline against the world currencies merely plays into
            the hands of foreigners since their expenses are reduced when
            converted into dollars: it would be cheaper to pay for education and
            living in the country. <br />
            When you select a city for education, please keep in mind that the
            highest prices are in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg, while expenses in
            other regions will be lower.
            <br />
          </p>

          <h2>Basic Expenses</h2>
          <p className={style.paraLight}>Education</p>
          <p>
            The tuition fee at Russian universities varies from RUB 122 500 to
            880,000 (USD 1,750-12,570) per year depending on the region,
            university, and discipline.
          </p>
          <div className={style.greyDiv}>
            <p>
              The students who are admitted to state-funded places on a
              competitive basis or who are awarded a government scholarship
              (quotas) study free-of-charge. Those students receive an allowance
              (the average monthly allowance in 2020 is RUB 1,484/USD 22, for
              postgraduate students it is RUB 2,921/USD 42).
            </p>

          <p className={style.paraLight}>Education</p>
          <p>
            The price of rented student accommodation in Russia varies from 500
            to 35,000 roubles (USD 7-500) per month depending on the region,
            type and location of the lodging (dormitory, rented room, or
            apartment). <br />
            For more details see the "Accommodation" section.
          </p>
          <p className={style.paraLight}>Medical Insurance</p>
          <div className={style.greyDiv}>
            <p>
              A voluntary medical insurance policy (VMI) for students at Moscow
              universities costs from 4,000 to 12,000 roubles (USD 57-170) a
              year. The insurance shall cover the entire education period,
              though universities request that policies are paid by the year or
              the semester.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>See more details in the "Healthcare" section.</p>

          <p className={style.paraLight}>Meal Expenses</p>
          <p>
            According to official information, the minimum shopping basket
            (including bread, pasta, meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, milk, and
            sugar) in Russia costs 4209 roubles (USD 60) a month. Much depends
            on the region where people live and what and where they buy (corner
            shop, supermarket, market).
            <br />
            An average lunch check in Moscow cafes and restaurants ranges from
            800 to 2,000 roubles (USD 11-28), while a set lunch costs between
            270 and 420 roubles (USD 4-6). Fast-food prices are even lower.
          </p>
          <p className={style.paraLight}>Transport</p>
          <p>
            A single journey on the Moscow subway costs 57 roubles (about USD
            1), while a 60-journey travel card costs 1970 roubles (USD 28).
            <br />
            Using a student discount one can get a monthly Moscow underground
            card for 405 roubles (USD 6), the cost is even lower in other
            cities.
            <br />
            See more details in the "Transport" section.
          </p>
          <p className={style.paraLight}>Cellular Communication, Internet</p>
          <p>
            SIM-cards for mobile phones and tablets are sold in phone stores (do
            not buy them from street sellers). You need a national passport
            (indicating registration at your place of residence) and a migration
            card to buy a SIM-card. Ask in store for advice on the best rates
            (cost of calls, sms-text, data, etc.). The cost of a standard
            package of services ranges from 300 to 400 roubles (USD 4-6). When
            you buy a SIM-card, the cost of the card is credited to the phone
            number account and then you top up the balance depending on the
            tariff plan.

          <div className={style.greyDiv}>
            <p>
              Dormitories offer payable or free Internet access. When you rent
              an apartment, you are usually asked to pay for Internet
              separately, about 300 to 500 roubles (USD 4-7) per month,
              depending on the region, provider and rate.

          <p className={style.paraLight}>Clothing</p>
          <p>
            Moscow theatre tickets cost from 800 to 2,500 roubles (USD 11-36)
            and cinema tickets, 400 to 1000 roubles (USD 6-14). A museum costs
            200 to 1,000 roubles (USD 3-14).

            <p>

            roubles (USD 14-43) in other regions. When you buy an annual pass,

            4-7) in Moscow and less elsewhere.
            <br />
            Many universities have their own gyms, swimming pools, and sports
            centres where services are cheaper than in the city or even free for
            university students.

            buy drinks and snacks. The average price of a cocktail in Moscow
            clubs is 500 roubles (USD 7) and 300 roubles (USD 4) in other
