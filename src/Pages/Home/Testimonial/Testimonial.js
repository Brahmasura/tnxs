    stuExperience:"Hello Friends my name is Vaishali Singh and i am from Allahbad , INDIA. I Always wanted to become Doctor and help people with their health and cure them. Becoming Doctor in India can be tough because we have compitition and also study costs are whooping high. One of my friend's Elder brother Studied abroad so i made up my mind to study Abroad too and Russia was delightful choice. Russia is also good choice because of affordable medical education and compared to other European countires Currency rates are Pretty attractive. When i met reprentatives from GRADUATION ABROAD i did not knew about procedure for Applying admission in foreign country. But i was well assisted by team and within a week of applying for registration and admission my Student Visa was ready. I was also helped for registration at MCI and getting my documents attested. The Team GRADUATION ABROAD is very very understanding and caring. I would suggest GRADUATION ABROAD to all my upcoming fellow students. I am sure you all will be satisfied with services and Team GRADABROAD won't let you down.",

    stuExperience:"Its Really better to Study Abroad in Russia, Ukraine or Kazakhstan. Bieng Affordable it also provides better exposure and Interaction with People from many nationalities. My Father is Doctor himself and since childhood we saw dedication in him for his job and care for his patients. Maybe This is something we also learnt from him and i decided to be doctor after i realised somwhere inside me i also like to help people and cure their problems. In India i went through many medical enterance tests but it didn't worked out. At last i met representatives from GRADUATION ABROAD and i am still thankful to them that they took my Problem very seriously. I didn't had passport, nor i knew about any procedure to apply for foreign medcial collage. I was assisted very warmly by team and my all documentation and procedure was guided by team very precisly. They took care of every single procedure and i was informed about every step. Now i am in 4rth year and i can't wait to realise that my dream of bieng doctor came true. Team Graduation Abroad is creditable for making this come true. I thank them wholely.",
